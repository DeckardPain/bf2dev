						<h2><span class="title-up">Operation Overlord</span><span class="title-down">Omaha Beach</span></h2>
						<p>The stage is set for Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy and the beginning of the push toward final victory over Germany. While German headquarters focuses on Calais - thanks in large part to expert diversionary tactics by the Allies - the main invasion force zeroes in on a stretch of Normandy beaches further south, between Cherbourg and Le Havre. General Eisenhower's order to attack has mobilized an unprecedented military force. About 4,000 ships will deliver over 175,000 men and supplies to the Normandy beaches. As an advanced unit pushes toward Omaha Beach, the men onboard the landing craft know it will not be an easy mission. Even though air strikes have intensified against German coastal defenses, a formidable enemy awaits atop the cliffs.</p>

						<p>The most famous of the beaches due to the extremely heavy defenses, failed plans, and the subsequent lack of armored support for the landing infantry; in spite of overwhelming odds, however, the allies must drive the German defenders away from the coast, and link up two of the other landing zones; Utah and Gold beaches.</p>

						<p>The objective of the attacking American forces is to consolidate the U.S. beachheads (Utah Beach and Omaha Beach) and establishment of a continuous defensive line against expected German counterattacks. The defending German force must hold the city long enough to allow reinforcements on route from the south to arrive, prevent or delay the merging of the lodgments, and keep the U.S. First Army from launching an attack towards Lessay-Périers that would cut off the Cotentin Peninsula.</p>

						<h2><span class="title-up">Battle of the Bulge</span><span class="title-down">The Ardennes</span></h2>
						<p>In the Ardennes, the German Army has commenced a massive counterattack against a thin spot in the Allied front. Just when Allied leader envisioned an end to Germany's ability to conduct such an operation, German forces unleashed a sudden, all-out attack with everything they had. Surprising everyone, the attack has already resulted in heavy damages. Not only were the Allies surprised by the number of men unleashed in this attack, but they were also caught off guard by the number of armored units. With war-weary veterans and an ever-increasing amount of teenaged soldiers, German forces have been fighting desperately to stop the Allied advance across the Siegfried Line and into Germany.</p>

						<p>Miss Hastie might have had an awkward experience at the spring where she elected to perform her ablutions, of whose periodical activity she was at the time unaware. During breakfast, one of the guides informed us that the small geyser Miss Hastie had been using as her hot-water tap had "gone off." Subsequent experience proved such pools untrustworthy for washing of any kind. A number of handkerchiefs left by themselves to soak were found an hour or two later making their way down an escape hole in the basin, and one that had been entirely absorbed by suction was not returned during a subsequent eruption by the dishonest geyser.</p>
						<p>We erected our tents beside a blue warm-water stream facing the sinter terraces, and as the next day was Sunday, we camped there for two nights. We all took a number of photographs of the terraces and the hot springs, and tried to catch the small geysers when they erupted, as with a few exceptions they did at short intervals; it is true that the eruption was not very violent, and the water was not thrown to a great height, three feet, perhaps, being the maximum.</p>

						</figure>
						<p>The next day was devoted to exploring the surrounding neighbourhood, and the different members of the party were struck with different features. Thomas and I set off together. We made for the higher ground, and looked round; we at once saw that we were at the edge of a recent (geologically) lava flow. About four miles distant there stuck up two horns, which we afterwards discovered to be the only prominent remains of the cone of the volcano, Strytur, whence the lava had been ejected. Strytur stands in the middle of the long strip of country lying between, and about equidistant from, the two great ice-fields, Lang Jökull and Hoff Jökull, the area of each of which is roughly about five hundred square miles. </p>

						<p>The strip is about fourteen miles wide at its narrowest part (not eight as shown on the existing maps), and extends north and south about twenty-five miles. Strytur is on the divide, or water-parting, between one system of rivers flowing north and another flowing south, and it stands on the highest part of this strip of land. The lava, as it issued from the volcano, flowed north and south down gentle declivities, and spread out east and west almost to the outlying ranges on the margins of the ice-fields. North it extends to just beyond Dufufell, and south almost to Lake Hvitarvatn.</p>
